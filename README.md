## A collection of projects and exercises written in C++ to recall university knowledge, keep practicing, and learn new things

This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises in C++ that I have created to refresh and enhance the knowledge I gained during university, while also exploring advanced topics.

### Objectives:
1. **Basics**: Setting up the development environment (e.g., PC, compiler), and reviewing procedural programming concepts (e.g., types, control statements, functions, separate source and header files, etc.).
2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Learning about classes and key OOP principles such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
3. **Advanced Skills**: To be defined.

### Structure:
The projects are organized in chronologically numbered folders, following the logical chapters and sections of the [C++ Guide](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/index.htm).
